    "<h1> 1. Introduction </h1>\n",
    "<p> The essential limitations of linear operations occur when, for example, the distribution of noise in the image is no longer gaussian, and moreover, this noise is not additive. Such a noise is the impulsive type noise, characterized by maximum or minimum amplitudes relative to the range of values from the image. The impulsive noise replaces some of the pixels of the images by very small or very high values, the result being what is called \"salt and pepper\" type noise, due to points very light (white) and very dark (black) that replace the image pixels</p>\n",
    "<p> Applying a linear smoothing filter to such a noise would result in an accentuation of the noise points by \"stretching\" them and incorporating the correct values around them, as we can see in Fig. 1.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p> A different class of filters is thus necessary. Such filters are nonlinear - they are no longer based on the principle of superposition. An essential class of such filters are those of ordering, which have the effect of pushing extreme values (outliers) at the beginning or end of the array of values from a neighborhood.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Rank order filters are local, neighbourhood operators - the filter is defined on a neighbourhood. The filter selects the gray values from the neighbourhood of the current pixel and the selected values are sorted ascendingly; we will denote the values of the pixels from the neighbourhood with {x1, x2, ..., xK}, and the same values sorted ascendingly with {x(1), x(2), ..., x(K)}. The values x(i)are called rank ordered statistics and have the property: </p>\n",

    "<h2> 2.1 The Median Filter </h2>\n",
    "<p> The median filter is a particular case of the rank order filter in which the returned value is the value in the middle of the sequence of ordered values. This is suitable for eliminating salt and pepper noise, because the extreme values will be at the beginning and end of the sorted array, thus in the middle we will have values close to the original value replaced by noise (given the spatial correlation of pixels in the image)</p>\n",

    "<p> In practice, considerring neighbourhoods with odd number of pixels, the median filter will be</p>\n",

    "<h2 id=\"2-2\"> 2.2 Weighted rank order filters </h2>\n",
    "<p> Both linear and order filters are based on the same principle of the sliding window. The processing performed on the selected values is different, but it can be noticed that the linear filtering structure allows the realization of an infinite number of linear filters for the same window (by varying the weighting coefficients </p>\n",
    "<p> The weighting of order filters cannot be done by multiplying the values selected by the window with different coefficients. Instead, the weighting can strengthen the influence of certain pixels in the filtering window. This is done by repeating several times an encountered value, to increase the probability of meeting it in the desired statistics.</p>\n",
